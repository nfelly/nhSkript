							<p><h4>Q: Why have this?</h4></p>
							<p>A: nhSkript has noticed that people have started up other forums (unofficial ones and ones in other languages), 
							we just want to make clear that even thought those other forums exist, ShopSearch is NOT to be uploaded without
							prior permission from nhSkript.</p>
							
							<p><h4>Q: Can I upload to another forum?</h4></p>
							<p>A: The warning message at the top says about this. You're not allowed to upload ShopSearch anywhere (more about this below).
							Whether on another forum, the official forum, a blog, if there is a way to download ShopSearch then it is not allowed.
							Read below about translation rules and changed code.</p>
							
							<p><h4>Q: I translated ShopSearch to ___ can I upload it?</h4></p>
							<p>A: No. The code still belongs to use no matter what language translated to. Feel free to ask nhSkript for permission
							to upload and we'll most likely say yes (with terms and conditions) or ask for it, upload it and credit you as the
							translator.</p>
							
							<p><h4>Q: I customized the messages, code or something, can I upload that?</h4></p>
							<p>A: Like the translation one (above) - No. The code is still ours. While we don't mind people editing ShopSearch,
							we don't want people uploading every version because they fixed a spelling mistake. If you find a problem tell nhSkript
							and we will correct it. You can also do a Pull Request on Github and have the new code automatically added</p>
							
							<p><h4>Q: Can I have a mirror site, host a download or upload it to my forum thread (any forum) for download?</h4></p>
							<p>A: Nope, nope, nope! If you haven't grasped yet, the code is still ours and hosting it ANYWHERE is against the rules.
							We ask you don't have a mirror site or host it anywhere for public download with a public link (we don't mind you sharing with others
							the original or your modified version, just no sharing the link). You are NOT allowed to upload the file to any forum, blog or any
							source of download. This has been added to prevent people uploading ShopSearch to their thread/blog/whatever if its a required
							script. If you require ShopSearch then link to the thread and tell people to download there.</p>
							
							<p><h4>Q: How come nfell2009.uk has official ShopSearch pages? Can I do that?</h4><p>
							<p>A: nhSkript is ran by 2 people: nfell2009 and HoneyBuzzard. http://nfell2009.uk is owned by nfell2009 and is allowed to
							do anything related to ShopSearch (such as hosting a download etc.). You can have UNofficial documents but you must state that.
							Please note that all the rules on this page still apply even if you're providing doc's for ShopSearch.</p>
							
							<p><h4>Q: Can I get around any rules?</h4></p>
							<p>A: Actually, yes you can. Just tell nhSkript which rule and we will come to an agreement if that rule won't apply to
							what you want. We want people to have fun and be creative with ShopSearch, but all the rules are in 100% effect unless
							you're given permission from us!</p>
							
							<p><h4>Please note:</h4><p>
							<p>We said this in the question above, but we don't want ShopSearch to be tight and complicated in what you can and can't do, 
							all we're doing with this page is to tell people that there are rules to where you can post ShopSearch. We're not trying to be
							a jackass, all we're trying to do is protect our work from people who claim it as their own. We have worked hard on ShopSearch
							and don't want it just being thrown away. You may be asking can we do this, and yes we can. Copyright law allows us to protect
							our work and these rules are the ones that must be followed. NOTE! These rules do not apply to: nfell2009 and HoneyBuzzard as
							they're the creators of ShopSearch. If you have a problem with that then please contact us</p>
